# REquirements Manager - Universidad de Sevilla - REMUS (REM 1.3)

Repository for the Windows binary distribution of _REMUS_ (_REquirements Manager_ - Universidad de Sevilla) for beta testers.

Clone the repository in any directory and execute <code>bin/remus.exe</code>

The executable file and the resource DLLs are relatively stable. Changes will take place mainly in the XSLT stylesheets in the <code>xslt</code> directory and in the documentation project in the <code>doc</code> directory.

## Instalation in Linux with WINE

Probably, _remus_ can also be used in Linux with WINE following these tutorials (in Spanish):
